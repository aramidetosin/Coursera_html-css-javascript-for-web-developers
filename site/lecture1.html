    <p style="margin: 0 100px 0 100px; font-size: 1.5em;">In every BGP session, a node sends periodic keepalive messages to its peer. If the peer doesn’t receive a keepalive for a period known as the hold time, the peer declares the session as dead, drops the con‐ nection and all the information received on this connection, and attempts to restart the BGP state machine..</p>
    <p>Inside the data center, three minutes is a lifetime. The most com‐ mon values configured inside the data center are three seconds for keepalive and nine seconds for the hold timer.</p>
